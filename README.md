# `Arduino`

`Arduino` is low energy consuming `microcontroller`, built-in IDE with C-like programming language makes it super easy to learn and development for IOT device.

Its use scenario is very different from the Raspberry PI, that's why its price is not very cheap (compared to Raspberry PI which got the faster hardware spec). As it focuses on fast boot, no OS needed edge IOT device development. It got a very wide range of hardware product line, you can find your own needed product from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products).

A lot of exists libs you can choose to support fast development, even include the `Firebase` support which is great.

But its back draw also very explicitly, that's you can't build a very complex program which needs more CPU power or memory size. If you do need that requirement, then you better to go to Raspberry PI.

## DEV environment setup

- Go to [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/OldSoftwareReleases) download the DEV IDE.

- On `Mac`, you have to install the [USB-To-Serail-Driver](`CH34x_Install_V1.5.pkg`). 
Otherwise, you won't see the board serial port when u connected to the hardware. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tOAwJ8Rn9c) is the detail explanation.
